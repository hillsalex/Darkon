   @brief
      Wrapper around UMFPack for efficiently solving sparse linear systems of 
   the standard form Ax=b, including a cache of the factorization of A=LU such 
   that repeated invocations of solving Ax=b with the same A=LU can be 
   performed in nearly linear time by back-substitution of LUx=b.
   
   @note for more info on UMFPack (the internal linear solver), see
